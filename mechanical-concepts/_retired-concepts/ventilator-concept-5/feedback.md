# Concept 5
## Screw Drive Belt Pulley

### Notes:
- Keeping the screw drive, but eliminating the paddle-pulley mechanism to a simpler nylon belt
- Nearly all custom parts can be made from metal and 3D printing (for low resource manufacturing) and standard hardware.
- Very simple manufacturing and assembly time.

### Issues:
- Still requires custom 3D printed parts (time consuming, regulatory issues, cycle use of materials?)
