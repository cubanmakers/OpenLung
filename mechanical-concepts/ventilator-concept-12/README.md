**Production**
*  All custom parts are either sheet metal stampings or bar stock cut to length.
*  All rods and pipes are the same diameter
*  Only M5 and M8 screws
*  Design is setup to be equally well made as stampings, laser cuts or CNC milled parts
*  Only simple folds which can be equally done on a giant automotive press or a tiny workshop
*  Easily available skate board roller
*  Widely available 608 Ball bearings
*  The separate motor mounting plate can be easily customized to the mounting holes of the used motor

**Features:**
*  Minimal friction on the Ambubag
*  The cam track is replaceable when worn out
*  A ball bearing reduces wear on the cam track
*  Adjustable pump volume
*  Very good access to the Ambubag
*  Easily taken apart and disinfected
*  12V gear motor which has high torque and can even be run on a car battery for hours or days

**Malfunction Behaviour**
If the concept malfunctions the Ambubag is still fully operational and accessible. An alarm could shrill and a nurse starts hand pumping until the problem is remediated.
Concept 8 on the other hand will most likely fail by locking up on the hub-less ball-bearing-less roller. If that happens friction will pull the bag into the machine and possibly rapture it.
