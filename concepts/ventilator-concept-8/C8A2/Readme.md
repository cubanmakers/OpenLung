# Concept 8A2

## Notes:

The 8.2 would be using a Nema 23. I have a Nema 17 in the model but the 23 would perform better. The motor should rotate 3 turns per breath. I'm hoping the larger motor will handle the 3 turns. I'm looking forward to seeing how testing goes. In the meantime I'm looking at a simpler design, that takes a different approach with the pushing mechanism.
