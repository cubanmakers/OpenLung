## Overview:
### Considerations:
- Minimal production needed. We are working with limited resources.
- Infection control (By way of covering the unit in an easily cleaned enclosure)
  - Easily to clean between patient because it has a cover or because it can be otherwise sanitised.
- The ability to hang it on a wall might save space (see drager oxylog mounts) but not essential.
- Stackability for storage or tighter spaces in a ward.
  - This device will likely be used on a ward that has been turned into a temporary ICU.
  - So suboptimal access to O2 ports, electric outlets. (Ie likely lots of extension leads around the environ).  
  - Worktop/trolleys to put equip on may be limited or may take up too much floor space.
- Large buttons/dials/etc. (Coordinate with Controller Dev)
  - Users will be wearing masks they are notorious for fogging up so big bold buttons/labels.
  - IMPORTANT: Nothing that will accidentally move if I brushed past it while in a close environment
  - consider acetate or other clear cover for buttons
- Durable:
  - Ideally if I dropped it it would still work, but thatâ€™s not a must have by any means.
- A battery option so I can move a patient to another ward with ease.
