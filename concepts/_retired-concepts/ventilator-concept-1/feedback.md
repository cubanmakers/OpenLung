# Concept 1 - RETIRED
## Trevor’s first design, to be 3D printed.

### Notes:
- Inspired by MIT and Rice’s work.
- Simplicity was a focus.
- Idea was to seed the idea to the OSHW world.

## Issues:
- Much too large, printing time on the order of 10’s hours to days.
- Not easy to injection mold.
- Not ideal for various models of BVM’s
- Load on Stepper motor (nema 17) in axial direction WILL cause stalling under light loads.
- Hard to tune/hot swap BVMs
