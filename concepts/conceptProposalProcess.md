# Concept Proposal Process
## Team-based contribution
In this project, there are over 2,000 individuals contributing at any one time in various formats. With that said, there is a lot of management that has to happen in order for that to be productive. In this repository, you'll notice that our concepts directory has various concept directories within it. The requirements in each directory will be contained in of the README.md and team leads, identified by Project Management and listed in the README, can submit merge requests in order to have their progress updated to the public and rest of the project.
