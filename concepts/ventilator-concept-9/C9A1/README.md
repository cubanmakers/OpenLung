Concept design by @Peter Knief and @James (slack)

- Proof of concept of torsion actuation of the AMBU. Functioning by ‘wringing’ the AMBU bag between four struts.
 - NEMA-17 seems to provide adquate power, thanks to 5:1 torque advantage through gearing plus estimated 1.5 leverage advantage with torsion of the bars/cage.
 - Shown to pump apprximately 200ml with only +/-15 degree rotation, but the mechanism can travel an estimated +/-70 degrees rotation.
 - Given a required tidal volume of 500ml it seems that we can far exceed that with a full stroke.
 - Seem to eliminate some of the pinch points or risks to mechanical stress by distributing the compression along four rods, spread across the full length of the bag.
 - It has the ability ot more fully exercise the AMBU stroke volume by compressing along the full body of the bag.
 - Mechanically actuated in both directions (open and close) such bag can freely expand without needing to ‘lift’ the mechanism.
 - Minimise the number of linkages between motor and AMBU bag.
 - The AMBU bag can be removed without disassembly (fit in and out between the struts)
 - The design is likely easily adapted/scaled to different size/diameter/length AMBU bags.
 - ALl components are suitable for 3D printing or machining with 2.5D router, or lazer cutting.
 - The total print time for a unit is approximately 10 hours on one printer.
 - BOM includes:  NEMA-17(+) motor, 1 meter of M4 threaded bar, 2x cartridge roller bearings, nuts/bolts.
 - Printed using Pro-PLA from 3D Fuel https://www.3dfuel.com/ (Thanks!)
 - It does appear that the AMBU bag rotates slightly during actuation. Need to identify if this is an issue or if this rotation can be mitigated by adding rollers/sleeves to the struts that compress the bag.
