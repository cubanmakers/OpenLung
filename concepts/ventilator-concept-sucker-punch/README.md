**Features:**
*	All custom parts are either sheet metal stampings or rods and tubes cut to length.
*	All rods and tubes are the same diameter
*	Design is setup to be equally well made as stampings, laser cuts or CNC milled parts 
*	Most parts are orientation agnostic
*	Only one part needs folding. No large radii. No internal folds.
*	Easily available skate board roller
*	Widely available 608 Ball bearings
*	Minimal friction on the Ambubag
*	The cam track is replaceable when worn out
*	A ball bearing reduces wear on the cam track
*	Adjustable pump volume (Still needs some work) 
*	Very good access to the Ambubag
*	Easily taken apart and disinfected
*	12V gear motor
*	The separate motor mounting plate can be easily customized to the mounting wholes of the used motor
*	Most of the motor weight rests on the ground and not on the housing

*	Opposed to concept 8 the whole pump volume can be used
*	No risk of pulling the bag into the machine if the roller locks up
*	Due to the cam track mechanism the pump volume rises nonlinearly. Much like natural breathing. But I donâ€™t know if this makes a difference.

**Issues to be addressed:** 
*	The air volume adjustment is not yet bullet proof
*	0 points for looks. Everything is geared towards cost and ease of manufacture.
*	Little space for the driver circuit
