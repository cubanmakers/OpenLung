## Current Collab Docs:

## Overview:
 * A pressure vessel (box) contains the BVM 
   * Compressed Air as mechanism to squeeze BVM
   * Live working prototype (video) achieving pressure and volume, hopefully in spec range very soon.
   * Very simple build. (Two valves + 1 sensor) on Arduino, $25 + saw + screwdriver to build basics. 
 

### Considerations:
  * Needs packaging, BOM, formalizing on many fronts.
   * Direct, reliable control of BVM Pressure/Volume
   * Needs method to replace BVM quickly
   * Needs Emergency/Transfer Mode Port where an external manual bag can be used while patient is transferred to device, or when any alarm/fail occurs
