### From origin

>This software is designed to control a Bag Valve Mask (BVM) AmbuBag medical Ventilator as part of the global effort to develop a fast, effective, easily replicable device >using distributed digital manufacturing techniques including 3D printing, CNC or laser cutting. The project uses an Arduino Nano with Atmega328P. The software can be used >with a wide range of mechanical designs.
