## I did tests on a Ambu- bag and noticed a few things. Buckling, shortening..
### Submitted by: @Einarsson
Hi I just received an Ambu-bag - Since there was a shortage I could only get a child size and it is the disposable version. ~$30 It seems like a very good product for that amount of money though.

What I find is that squeezing the bag by hand - grip at center , the bag collapses very nice, whilst when squeezing against a cavity like shown in K7 - the bladder bends and buckles a bit. I think this would result in rupture despite periodic rotation of the bladder. (on this particular model)

Pressing with only one finger reduces this buckling, and lets it "bend" linearly, and maybe the "skateboard wheel" in K7 could be narrow enough to not interfere with the tapering ends of the bladder.

Pinching the bag from both sides would be preferable though as seen in a few earlier concepts, but I understand it might re-introduce too much complexity.

I further notice that when squeezing the bag, the length is reduced some. Maybe it is of no concern as long as the bag don't wander off. the length of the child size bladder is reduced by approximately 12 mm. (Much like a Festo "fluid muscle", but the opposite.

Keep up the good work - and thank you all for the work you do. I have not seen any issues that I think would impede a well functioning ventilator , that you haven't taken care of so far. If I get ahead of the game I will contribute, but so far I am behind.

Kind Regards
