## Usage notes

This document is a system design specification for the electronic system design planned to be used in the Open Source Ventilator project and designed by the Velocity Team.

This document shall be used as a reference to participate in the OSV & OSV-Velocity team design and to understand the working principles of the Electronic Control System.

The here detailed system is designed to work with the Mechanical Concept 13, but, as it is modular and mechanical concept agnostic oriented, it can be used by all the other mechanical concepts too (but verify compatibility first!)

This document is not final and is being updated as the design process progresses on the structure of the guideline system design document linked at the end of this page.

This document provides definitive system specifications for the electronics system developed by the velocity team, based on feedback from users and designers.

For a relaxed specification to be used as a Guideline to start new system designs from scratch, please wait for the System Design Guideline to be published again. (Or read the specification document here linked by understanding that the specific components and architecture described in the pages can vary, but the safety and sensors needs are valid for every design concerning a BVM).
