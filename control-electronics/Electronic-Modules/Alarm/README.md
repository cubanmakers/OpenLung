# Alarm Module

## Scope:
- The alarm board singnals the need of user intevention on the system both in a visive and auditory way.

## Signalling
An alarm should be conveyed in two ways: using yellow, red lights, and sirens/buzzers.

## More details:
Check the System Specification Document at the following link, "Visual and acoustic Alarm Board section"

## Collaborating
- If a new design is started, please try to keep the dimensions highlighted in this readme, including connectors and their pitch.
- If you think you can compress the design, feel free to redo it in the same PCB outline while adding a SilkScreen square around your component placement, imagine this square to be your suggested PCB outline. This way, if your module will be chosen to be implemented in a single board ES, a reduction in footprint will be possible by trimming the edge of the module to your suggested pcb outline.
