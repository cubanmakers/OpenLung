# User Experience Electronic Module
---
## Scope:
- To interface the system with the user, showing all the required data and giving the possibility to modify the behaviour of the machine.



## User Experience
For a User Experience overview, please consult the following link. To start a user interface design without reading this document and understanding what the needs of a user might be is strongly discouraged.

## Detailed Requirements

More information on User Interface requirements can be found in the System Design specification requirement document at the following link:

The user interface module should, if possible, allow for a digital SPI/UART inteface and GPIO connections to the actuators needed for user interaction.

## Collaborating
- If a new design is started, please try to keep the dimensions highlighted in this readme, including connectors and their pitch. (currently not defined for this module, therefore feel free to suggest or to ask to one of the coordinators).
- If you think you can compress the design, feel free to redo it in the same PCB outline while adding a SilkScreen square around your component placement, imagine this square to be your suggested PCB outline. This way, if your module will be chosen to be implemented in a single board ES, a reduction in footprint will be possible by trimming the edge of the module to your suggested pcb outline.
