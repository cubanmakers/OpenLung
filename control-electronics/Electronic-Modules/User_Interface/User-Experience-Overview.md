## Usage Notes

- This Document provides a user experience overview on mechanical ventilation. Its purpose is to give developers a clinical care point of view regarding the actions that are needed on a patient in need of mechanical ventilation and assistance. 
- Disregarding any of the procedures, protocols or mode of operations reported in this document or in its sources without a clear approval from a medical equipe directly involved into the treatment of patients in need of mechanical ventilation is strongly discouraged as it might lead to wrong design choices, wrong therapy delivered and, if not stopped in time by strict testing and validation procedures, loss of lives.
- This document is written in the same manner as a lecture notebook, not as a study book would be. If anything is unclear, feel free to propose a change or ask by adding a comment next to the section of interest.
