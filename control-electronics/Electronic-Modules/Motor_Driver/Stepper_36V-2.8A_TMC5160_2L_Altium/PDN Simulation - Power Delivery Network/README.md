## NOTES on the simulation:

- The simulation was done by assuming that the needed upgrade of the MOSFET stage already took place. 
- A MOSFET CHANGE does not affect the simulation.
- The current MOSFETs support only up to 40V, the simulation was done at 48V (nominal target for at least one mechanical concept (13)).
- Decreasing the drive voltage to 36V lowers the current density by 20%, but even in that case the simulation outcome would not change as the layout shows two fuse-like structures.
