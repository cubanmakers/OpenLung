# BVM FILTER

## Welcome to BVM filtration

This is a spot dedicated to the design, review, prototyping and testing of a functional patient circuit HEPA or other small particulate filter.

## Reasons for an in circuit ventilation fileter

To reduce the contamination of frontline medical care workers or the spread to other patients in an enclosed space. Large complex ventilators contain some kind of filtration, whereas a BVM or Ambu-Bag based ventilater circuit releases exhaled air freely.
## Requirements

* Must be easily produced
* Must significantly reduce or fully remove the chance of exhaled particulate matter
* Must not significantly restrict airflow in the ventilation circuit
* Must be cleanable without small crevisis, or be disposable and easily replaced
* Must fit one or more standard ventilation circuit hose diameters
