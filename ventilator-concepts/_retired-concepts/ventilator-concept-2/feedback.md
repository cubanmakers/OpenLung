# Concept 2  - RETIRED
## McMaster Carr + NC Special

### Notes:
- Simplifying design to use McMaster Carr off the shelf components and flat cut components.
- This eases supply chain

### Issues:
- Hard to tune/hot swap BVMs
- Supply chain unknown in many places.
- Not ideal for various models of BVMâ€™s
