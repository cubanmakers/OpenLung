## Ventilators Standards

Published and downloadable at: https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/topics/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/ventilators/

The UK Government is looking for businesses that can support in the supply of ventilators and ventilator components across the UK as part of our response to COVID-19.
A specification for ventilators to be used in UK hospitals during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has now been developed. This guidance sets out the clinical requirements based on the consensus of what is ‘minimally acceptable’ performance in the opinion of anesthesia and intensive care medicine professionals and medical device regulators.
Several standards are referred to within this document. In support of the efforts being made and in collaboration with MHRA, BSI has worked with international standards organizations to make these standards accessible for the purposes of organizations that are involved in the UK COVID-19 response. BSI may add additional standards as required.
